# bcb-scripts

A bunch of scripts to help us in our work at BCB Radio 106.6FM in Bradford UK

## CleanUp.py
This is a script that cleans up a directory that often gets polluted with rogue files

## archive.py 
Runs over 'Transport' files generated by Myriad v2.6 and archives the WAV files as .mp3 files with metadata
